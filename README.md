# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
This project presents and discusses data-driven predictive models for predicting the defaulters among the credit card users. Data used include details like limit balance, age, sex, amount of bill statement, repayment status and amount of previous payment. The paper discusses which variables are the strongest predictors of default, and to make predictions on which customers are likely to default. Four machine learning models were trained with repeated cross validation and evaluated in a testing set: (a) logistic regression,(b)KNN, (c) decision tree, (d) Na√Øve Bayes ,(e)Random Forest and Ensembling methods like Boosting and  Bagging. The base model gave 81% R-square value with all the variables without any treatment.
